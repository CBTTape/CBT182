ST LOUIS, March 20, 2024 (UNDERDOG NEWSWIRE) -

The PDS command that runs on the latest z/OS operating system
today was developed more than five decades ago on the OS/360
operating system.

Tom Springer, Steve Smith and William Finkelstein were the
original authors in 1972 when they worked together at Security
Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.

From 1977 through 1990, Bruce Leland and Steve Smith changed the
landscape of the PDS command by adding a vast number of new
subcommands and ISPF dialog functions.  All of which, is written
in reentrant assembly language.

In the late 1990's, Janko Kalinic and Greg Price enhanced PDS
after years of dormancy.  PDS was modified to support Year 2000
dates, CUA panel design, Partitioned Data Set Extended format,
ISPF extended statistics, PDSE datasets in a cylinder-managed
area, Eight character TSO userids, z/OS Binder API calls, SMP
installation, PDSE V2 member generations, and new subcommands
with interfaces to standard utility programs.
