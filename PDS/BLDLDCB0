  BLDL  0,BLDLLIST

  BLDL with a zero DCB address indicates that the data set search
  order begins with the task libraries, then proceeds to the job
  library or step (whichever is active) followed by the link list
  libraries.


  There are numerous dynamic STEPLIB products that all use their own
  DDNAME naming convention.  A BLDL with a non-zero DCB can be used
  to search dynamic tasklibs.
